# FunE: Game Assistant
![Logo](/MVP/logo.png)
## What It Does
FunE is an application with the goal of assisting users in managing games across many platforms. It tracks when a game is launched and notes its name and location. From this point, the game is added to the menu and can be launched from there.
## How To Use
Only functions on windows. Just extract the folder the launch the EXE file. From there, it can be minimized and found in the system tray. Upon launching a game, the UI should update. (If I can code) The reset button will most likely break it, so just don't.
## Future Plans
In the near future, a few things are planned.
  - Fix reset button.
  - Sales aggregator.
  - Platform detection.
  - Actual UI.
