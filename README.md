## What It Does
FunE is an application with the goal of assisting users in managing games across many platforms. It tracks when a game is launched and notes its name and location. From this point, the game is added to the menu and can be launched from there.
## Future Plans
In the near future, a few things are planned.
  - First functional build.
  - Sales aggregator.
  - Platform detection.
  - Actual UI.
