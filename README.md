# FunE: Game Assistant
![Logo](/FunE/logo.png)
## What It Does
FunE is an application with the goal of assisting users in managing games across many platforms. It tracks when a game is launched and notes its name and location. From this point, the game is added to the menu and can be launched from there.
## How To Use
Only functions on windows. Just extract the folder the launch the EXE file. From there, it can be minimized and found in the system tray. Upon launching a game, the UI should update. (If I can code)

If the version is updated, data can be transferred by copying the games.json and covers file from the old version and replacing the ones in the new version.
