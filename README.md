# FunE: Game Assistant
![Logo](/MVP/logo.png)
## What It Does
FunE is an application with the goal of assisting users in managing games across many platforms. It tracks when a game is launched and notes its name and location. From this point, the game is added to the menu and can be launched from there.
## How To Use
Only functions on windows. Just extract the folder the launch the EXE file. From there, it can be minimized and found in the system tray. Upon launch, the UI should update. (If I can code)
## Future Plans
In the near future, a few things are planned.
  - First functional build.
  - Sales aggregator.
  - Platform detection.
  - Actual UI.
